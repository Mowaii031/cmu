# CMU-ELECT — React + Django Login & Forgot Password

This version keeps the React + Django architecture but adds a real database-backed authentication flow for **Login** and **Forgot Password** while keeping the existing Dashboard, Voting, and Analytics pages connected to the same Django API.

## What is actually working?

### Login
- Student / Alumni / Faculty role selection.
- Login uses the user's **CMU email + password**.
- Django checks the account and role against the database.
- A Django REST Framework token is returned and stored by React.
- Protected pages redirect back to Login when there is no token.
- Logout invalidates the token.

### Forgot Password
The flow matches the supplied screens:

1. Forgot Password → enter CMU email.
2. Django finds the account and creates a short-lived 6-digit verification code.
3. In local development, the email is printed in the Django terminal and the code is also shown in the React UI as a **Development code**.
4. Verification → enter the code.
5. Django verifies it and issues a short-lived reset token.
6. New Password → enter and confirm the new password.
7. Django changes the user's password and invalidates existing login tokens.
8. Return to Login and sign in with the new password.

For a real deployment, configure Django SMTP so the verification code is actually sent to the CMU email address. Do not expose `dev_code` in production.

## Do I need real CMU data right now?

**No.** You need database records for authentication to work, but you should not put real student/faculty/alumni information into the development project just to test it.

The included `seed_demo` command creates safe fake records:

| Role | CMU Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Student | `student@cmu.edu` | `DemoPass123!` |
| Alumni | `alumni@cmu.edu` | `DemoPass123!` |
| Faculty | `faculty@cmu.edu` | `DemoPass123!` |

It also creates demo elections, positions, and candidates so Login → Dashboard → Voting is connected to actual database data.

The project paper describes the intended system as using a verified university voter registry as the baseline for eligible users, so real CMU data can be imported later through an approved process rather than hard-coded into React. See the project's description of the voter database and authentication flow. fileciteturn0file1L57-L61 fileciteturn0file0L16-L19

## Architecture

```text
React (localhost:5173)
        |
        | JSON API
        v
Django REST API (127.0.0.1:8000/api/)
        |
        v
Django ORM
        |
        v
SQLite (development)
```

The existing project specification describes Django/Python as the backend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, MySQL as the intended centralized database, Chart.js for visualization, and session-based authentication. This React version keeps the same separation of responsibilities while using React for the UI and DRF tokens for the local prototype. fileciteturn0file2L94-L107

## Setup on Windows PowerShell

### 1. Backend

Open a terminal:

```powershell
cd path\to\cmu-elect-react-django\backend
py -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py migrate
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py seed_demo
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver
```

You do **not** need to activate `Activate.ps1`. The commands above directly use `backend\venv` and avoid the PowerShell execution-policy problem.

### 2. Frontend

Open a second terminal:

```powershell
cd path\to\cmu-elect-react-django\frontend
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open the Vite URL, normally:

```text
http://localhost:5173/
```

Keep the Django terminal running at the same time.

## Important: database data

The database is not created just by writing models. The normal development flow is:

```text
models.py
   ↓
migrations
   ↓
migrate
   ↓
SQLite database tables
   ↓
seed_demo
   ↓
fake users + elections + candidates
```

So yes, **Login needs user records to authenticate against**, but those records can be fake development records. Later, the approved CMU voter registry can populate the user table.

## Main API endpoints

```text
POST /api/auth/login/
POST /api/auth/logout/
GET  /api/auth/me/

POST /api/auth/forgot-password/
POST /api/auth/resend-code/
POST /api/auth/verify-code/
POST /api/auth/reset-password/

GET  /api/elections/
POST /api/votes/
GET  /api/elections/<id>/results/
```

## Security notes

This is a capstone prototype, not a production election-security deployment. Before a real CMU deployment, add institution-controlled authentication/SSO, HTTPS, environment-based secrets, proper email delivery, rate limiting, audit logging, backups, stronger authorization rules, careful separation/anonymization of voter identity and ballots, and a production database such as MySQL/PostgreSQL.

The project documentation specifically describes separating voter identity from final selections and validating duplicate votes before storing validated ballots. fileciteturn0file3L120-L123
